There could be many reasons why you are feeling this way, including stress, difficult life events, loneliness, or even chemical imbalances in the brain. It's important to remember that it's okay to not have all the answers right away and that it's okay to seek help when you're feeling overwhelmed. Talking to a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life can help you understand and address what you're feeling. You are not alone, and there is support available to you.\n",
